# Queue
Component provides a unified API across a variety of different queue services. 
Queues allow you to defer the processing of a time consuming task, such as 
sending an e-mail, until a later time, thus drastically speeding up the web 
requests to your application.

**Attention please!** The component works independently of Phalcon\Queue and completely replaces it.
